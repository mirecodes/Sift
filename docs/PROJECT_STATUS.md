# Sift — Project Status

> Snapshot for planning discussions. Written for a product/planning reader, not for engineers.
> As of 2026-10-07 (last code change 2026-09-30, version 0.1.0, not released).
> Sources of truth: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (structure and settled decisions), `DESIGN.md` (look and feel), `CHANGELOG.md` (history by guidance file), `DECISIONS.md` (human-only ADR log). All built work so far is **guidance_v1**; the next plan arrives as `guidance_v2.md`.

## 1. What Sift is

A Pomodoro-style focus timer with a collectible reward. You focus; if the session lasts 25 minutes or more you earn a random animal; the animal moves onto your small floating 3D island; the island grows as your collection grows.

**Core loop:** Focus → Break (reward reveal) → Focus again, each step one tap.

**Guiding rule:** nothing interrupts a focus session. No popups, badges, or animations while focusing; all the fun happens during the break.

**Where it stands:** milestones M1–M6 (everything for the desktop web version) are done, and a lot of world detail was added on top. M7 (mobile apps) has not started. All data lives in the browser on one device.

## 2. Tech stack and architecture

### 2.1 Stack (plain terms)

| Area | Choice | What it means for planning |
|---|---|---|
| App type | Web app running locally in a desktop browser | No server, no accounts, no install |
| UI | React + TypeScript | Standard, well-supported web stack |
| 3D world | three.js (via React Three Fiber) | The island and animals are real-time 3D, drawn in the browser |
| Art | Voxel (Minecraft-like blocks), defined in code | No external 3D model files; every animal is a small block model written as data |
| Sound | Generated in the browser | No audio files; chimes are synthesized |
| Storage | IndexedDB (browser database) | Data stays on this device and this browser only |
| Future mobile | Capacitor (planned) | Wrap the same web app as iOS/Android apps instead of rewriting |

### 2.2 How the app is organized

Think of it as five layers, each with one job:

1. **Rules (domain)** — timer, reward odds, island shape, animal catalog, stats. Pure logic with no screen or browser code, so it is fully unit-tested.
2. **App state (store)** — the single "what is happening now" (idle, focusing, on break) and the actions that change it.
3. **Screens** — Home, Focus, Break, Settings, Collection (flat 2D interface on top).
4. **World** — the 3D island scene behind the screens. One scene stays alive across Home, Focus and Break, so moving between them feels continuous.
5. **Platform adapters** — every device feature (storage, keep-screen-awake, fullscreen, sound/notifications, vibration) goes through a small adapter. Today only web versions exist; mobile versions can be dropped in later without touching the rest.

### 2.3 Screens and flow

```
Home ──Start focus──▶ Focus ──time reached──▶ Overtime ──End focus──▶ Break ──▶ Break over
  ▲                    │                                               │             │
  └──── Hold to stop (no reward) ◀┘                                    └── Home / Start focus now
```

| Screen | What the user sees |
|---|---|
| Home | Full-screen island with animals, "25 MIN FOCUS · 5 MIN BREAK", Start focus button, theme / collection / settings icons |
| Focus | Near-black screen, big timer, dimmed island behind it. A hidden "Hold to stop" appears on mouse move |
| Break | Reward card (tier badge, spinning 3D animal, name), break timer, "Start focus now" and "Home" |
| Settings | Focus length, break length, chimes on/off. Saves instantly |
| Collection | Stats strip (total focus time, sessions, species found) and a grid of all 50 animals, unfound ones as silhouettes |

## 3. Implemented features

Legend: **[+]** = not in the initial plan, added later at the owner's request.

### 3.1 Timer and focus session
- Focus length 5–60 min (5-min steps), break 1–30 min. Defaults 25 / 5.
- When planned time is reached, the timer keeps counting up as **overtime** (`+05:23`) until the user taps End focus.
- **Hold to stop** (1.5 s long press) to abandon; abandoning gives no reward.
- Timer stays correct across tab switches, sleep, and page reloads; an in-progress session resumes after reload.
- Focus enters fullscreen and keeps the screen awake.
- Controls on Focus auto-hide after 3 s.
- Gentle chimes at focus end and break end (toggle in Settings).
- Break ends in a "Ready for the next one?" state; the next focus never starts automatically.
- Keyboard: Space = main action, hold Esc = stop. Reduced-motion setting of the OS is respected.

### 3.2 Rewards
- Reward only if effective focus time ≥ 25 min. Effective time = planned + overtime, **capped at 60 min**.
- Tier is rolled at random; longer focus nudges the odds up slightly:

  | Tier (low → high) | Odds at 25 min | Odds at 60 min | Species |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Common | 60% | 50% | 25 |
  | Mythic | 28% | 32% | 14 |
  | Epic | 10% | 14% | 9 |
  | Legendary | 2% | 4% | 2 (Unicorn, Tiger) |

- Species is picked uniformly within the tier. Duplicates are allowed and each one is placed on the island.
- Reveal on the Break screen: card fades in, model spins, a tier-specific chime plays; after 3.5 s (or a tap) the animal appears on the island.
- Sessions under 25 min show a neutral, non-guilt message instead.

### 3.3 Island and world
- Floating voxel island in a fixed isometric view; bobs gently; clouds drift behind it.
- Island grows with the number of animals; the same save always produces the same island.
- Growth plays as a short animation when returning Home after a reward.
- Animals are placed automatically on a free tile near the center and play idle animations (turn, hop, shuffle). Fish flops; Legendary animals sparkle.
- Home allows limited rotation and zoom of the island.
- Focus dims the island, slows animals to 25% speed and lowers the frame rate to save battery.
- **[+] Terrain heights** — hills, plains and lowlands instead of a flat top; the area around the camp stays flat.
- **[+] Stream** — every island has one winding stream with a bubbling spring, small waterfalls at height steps, a fall off the island edge, and splash particles. Animals are never placed on water.
- **[+] Night mode** — day/night toggle in the top bar (saved). Night has a starry sky, cool moonlight and a lit campfire.
- **[+] Camp** — every island has a campfire in the center and a log cabin next to it (smoke from the chimney at night).
- **[+] Focus routines** — when focus starts, animals react: by day they walk into the cabin; by night they lie down and sleep near it. They come back out on Break.
- **[+] Poke an animal** — clicking an animal (not during Focus) shows a "!" bubble and makes it do one action.
- **[+] Special animations** — the butterfly flaps and flies around above the island; the unicorn bursts rainbow particles every few seconds.

### 3.4 Collection and stats
- Grid of all 50 species with pixel-art sprites, tier badges and "×3"-style counts; unfound species are silhouettes with "???".
- Stats: total focus time, completed sessions, species found (`n / 50`). All-time totals only.

### 3.5 Developer-only switches **[+]**
- `config/app.yaml` (bundled at build time):
  - **Test mode** — fills the island with animals at startup (in memory, never saved). Can place every species at once.
  - **Reset map on start** — new island and no saved animals on every launch.
- Both are **currently ON** (see 6.1).

## 4. Data model

All data is stored in the browser's IndexedDB on the user's device. Nothing leaves the device.

| Record | One per… | Key contents |
|---|---|---|
| **Settings** | app | focus minutes, break minutes, chimes on/off, theme (day/night) |
| **World** | app | the island seed (a random number fixed once; it decides the island's shape, terrain and stream) |
| **Active phase** | app | what is happening right now (idle / focusing since X / on break since X, with the pending reward). Lets a reload resume exactly where the user was |
| **Focus session** | focus attempt | start time, planned length, end time, effective length, status (running / completed / abandoned), the reward it produced |
| **Placed animal** | earned animal | species, tier, tile position on the island, when earned, which session earned it |

Notes for planning:
- The island itself is **not stored**: it is recomputed from the seed plus the number of animals. Only animal positions are stored, and they stay valid as the island grows.
- Ending a focus writes the session, the new animal and the switch to Break in **one atomic step**, so a crash cannot double-reward or lose a reward.
- IDs are UUIDs and times are UTC timestamps, so cloud sync can be added later without reshaping data.
- The database schema is at **version 3**. Versions 2 and 3 only rename stored tier names (see 5.2).
- The 50-species catalog is fixed data shipped with the app, not stored in the database.

## 5. Changes from the initial plan, and why

The initial plan is the first version of `ARCHITECTURE.md` (2026-09-29). Changes are recorded as ADRs in `DECISIONS.md`.

### 5.1 Content and world

| Initial plan | Now | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 20 animals | **50 animals** | Owner request: more variety, including insects, birds and sea creatures (ADR-023) |
| Unicorn as the only top-tier animal | **Unicorn + Tiger** | Owner request (ADR-023) |
| 5×5 island, slightly rounded square, flat top | **7×7, near-circular, terraced hills and lowlands** | Owner request: a more natural, less boxy island (ADR-017, ADR-018) |
| Animals about one block in size | **Animals at 1/4 scale; camera zoomed to the island top** | Owner request: animals look like small creatures in a landscape, blocks look larger (ADR-014) |
| No water | **Winding stream with spring and waterfalls** | Owner request. Added, removed, then re-added with a better design (ADR-020, ADR-021) |
| Day only | **Day/night theme, camp, focus routines** | Owner request: gives Focus a visible "the animals rest too" moment without breaking immersion (ADR-016) |
| No interaction with animals (Q7) | **Click to poke** (still no rearranging) | Owner request: small delight on Home/Break (ADR-022) |
| Every animal stays in its own tile | **Butterfly flies around**; large animals have longer bodies | Owner request for liveliness; rule relaxed per species only (ADR-024, ADR-025) |

### 5.2 Tier names (changed twice)

The initial plan ranked tiers Common < Epic < Legendary < Mythic. They were renamed twice (ADR-026, ADR-027) and now rank **Common < Mythic < Epic < Legendary**, with Legendary as the top. The probabilities, chimes and model sizes stay attached to the rank, not the name; stored animals were migrated automatically.

Why: owner preference for "Legendary" as the top word. **Watch out:** older ADRs and changelog entries use the old names, which reads confusingly.

### 5.3 Technical choices that differ from the first draft

| Draft | Now | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CSS Modules or Tailwind (undecided) | CSS Modules | Keeps one source of design tokens (ADR-001) |
| drei helper library for 3D | Not used; custom camera | Off-the-shelf controls fought the fixed isometric view and screen transitions (ADR-009) |
| Sound files | Synthesized chimes | No asset files, easier on mobile (ADR-006) |
| Mobile in M7 | Deferred | Finish web first; adapters are ready for mobile (ADR-002) |
| Wordmark in top bar | Removed | Less UI over the island |

---

## 6. Known issues, tech debt, unfinished parts

### 6.1 Must fix before any release
- **Developer switches are ON.** `resetMapOnStart: true` **deletes all earned animals on every launch**, and test mode fills the island with every species. Both must be set to `false` before anyone uses the app for real (ADR-015, ADR-019).
- **No backup or export.** Clearing browser data, switching browser, or switching device loses everything.

### 6.2 Unfinished / not started
- **Mobile (M7)**: no iOS/Android build, no native adapters, no scheduled notification for focus end. On the web the end chime only plays if the page is still open.
- No accounts or cloud sync (data model is prepared).
- No onboarding / first-run screen.
- No localization (all text is in one file, English only).
- Stats are all-time totals only; no daily/weekly view.

### 6.3 Gameplay and world limitations
- **Short focus never pays**: focus can be set to 5–20 min, but rewards need 25 min, so short-session users never earn anything without overtime (ADR-012, owner should confirm).
- **No pathfinding**: during Focus routines animals walk in straight lines and may pass through the cabin or across the stream.
- **Old saves can overlap new features**: animals saved before the camp or stream existed may sit on the cabin, campfire or water tiles.
- The butterfly can fly over water and the camp.
- On the smallest island the stream can end up almost straight.
- Adding species lowers each species' chance within its tier (pick is uniform), so the 25 Common species are slow to complete.
- Tier card colors (blue, pink, orange with white text) are below the target contrast ratio; the tier name is always shown as text to compensate.
- The 100-animals-at-60fps performance target has not been measured.

### 6.4 Decisions still waiting for the owner
Several ADRs are **Proposed**, meaning a default was applied but not confirmed: styling (001), mobile deferral (002), open-question defaults (004), one tile per animal (005), synthesized sounds (006), reward preview (007), terrain blocks (008), Break layout (011), short focus (012), night mode and camp (016).

Open questions from the plan, with the current default (ADR-004):

| # | Question | Current default |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Fish tier | Common |
| Q2 | Tier odds (60/28/10/2 → 50/32/14/4) | Accepted as is |
| Q3 | Animals during Focus | Slowed (plus the day/night routines) |
| Q4 | Auto-start next focus after break | No |
| Q5 | Ambient sound during focus | None, end chime only |
| Q6 | Long breaks (e.g. every 4 cycles) | Not supported |
| Q7 | User can arrange animals | No (poke only) |
| Q8 | Rewards other than animals | No |
| Q9 | Stats screen | Simple all-time totals |
| Q10 | Accounts / sync | Local only |
| Q11 | Mobile approach | Capacitor wrapper |

### 6.5 Documentation drift
- Older ADRs use pre-rename tier names (`ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` were rewritten with the current names on 2026-10-07).
- The `footprint` field (animals larger than one tile) exists in the catalog but is unused.

### 6.6 Quality
- 329 unit tests pass and type checking is clean (checked 2026-10-07).
- One browser smoke test exists (`npm run e2e`); it needs a build and a one-time browser install and was not run for this snapshot.
- 8 commits, all on `main`. Work started 2026-09-29; the first commit and all later ones are dated 2026-09-30.
