# DESIGN.md

> Single source of truth for Sift's design.
> **Part I — UI Design** covers everything drawn in the DOM (screens, text, buttons, panels, timer, sound, copy).
> **Part II — Rendering** covers everything drawn by three.js (sky, island, blocks, animals, camera, lighting).
> The two parts never share colors: UI tokens are not used on 3D objects, and world colors are not used in UI components.

## 0. Design Principles

1. **Calm over exciting.** The app supports focus; it never competes for attention.
2. **Engineered restraint.** Near-black and white carry the interface. Color is rare and meaningful.
3. **Confident, not loud.** Type weights stay between 400 and 600.
4. **Dark and quiet while focusing, bright and alive at rest.** Focus = near-black and minimal. Home / Break = white UI over a colorful island.
5. **Accents are surfaces, not actions.** Chromatic colors fill cards and badges (reward tiers). Buttons are near-black or white.
6. **Reward delight happens after the work.** Celebratory motion only on the Break screen.
7. **Less UI.** If an element is not needed right now, hide it.

# Part I — UI Design

## 1. Design Language

The interface follows a Webflow-inspired language: a deep near-black `#080808` primary against a clean white canvas, a small set of saturated chromatic accents used as **surface fills** (never as buttons), and a single sans-serif family at restrained 400–600 weights with slight negative tracking at large sizes.

**Key characteristics**
- **Two-color action hierarchy.** Near-black for every primary action on light surfaces (white on dark surfaces), white-with-hairline for secondary actions.
- **Chromatic accents as surfaces.** Used at full saturation as reward-tier card fills and badges. In Sift, color appears mainly when a reward appears, which makes rewards feel valuable.
- **Single type family.** One family for display, body, and labels; variable weights do the work.
- **Tight, engineered shapes.** 4px buttons, 8px cards. No pill buttons.
- **Layered soft shadows** are the only elevation cue, used on panels floating over the island.

All tokens live in `src/ui/tokens.css` (CSS custom properties) and are mirrored in `src/ui/tokens.ts`. Never hard-code a value in a component.

## 2. Colors

### 2.1 Core

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-primary` | `#080808` | Primary buttons, headings, wordmark, Focus background. Deeper than pure black to read as intentional |
| `--color-on-primary` | `#FFFFFF` | Text/icons on primary; the Focus timer |
| `--color-canvas` | `#FFFFFF` | Panels, cards, sheets, Settings/Collection background |
| `--color-hairline` | `#D8D8D8` | 1px borders, dividers, input borders |
| `--color-hairline-inverse` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16)` | 1px borders on dark surfaces |
| `--color-overlay-focus` | `rgba(8, 8, 8, 0.82)` | Covers the island on the Focus screen |
| `--color-overlay-focus-night` | `rgba(8, 8, 8, 0.6)` | Same, in night mode, so the campfire and sleeping animals stay visible |

### 2.2 Text

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-ink` | `#080808` | Default text, headings |
| `--color-ink-strong` | `#222222` | Near-black emphasis |
| `--color-body` | `#363636` | Body paragraphs |
| `--color-body-mid` | `#5A5A5A` | Secondary text, captions |
| `--color-mute` | `#898989` | Low-priority text |
| `--color-mute-soft` | `#ABABAB` | Placeholders; secondary text on dark surfaces |

### 2.3 Accents

Surface fills, badges, and indicators only. **Never button backgrounds. Never add a new accent.**

| Token | Value | Sift usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-accent-purple` | `#7A3DFF` | Epic tier |
| `--color-accent-orange` | `#FF6B00` | Legendary tier; Overtime badge |
| `--color-accent-pink` | `#ED52CB` | Mythic tier |
| `--color-accent-blue` | `#3B89FF` | Reserved |
| `--color-accent-blue-info` | `#146EF5` | Info badge |
| `--color-accent-green` | `#00D722` | Success indicator (reserved) |
| `--color-accent-yellow` | `#FFAE13` | Warning (reserved) |
| `--color-accent-red` | `#EE1D36` | Destructive: Abandon long-press ring, errors |

### 2.4 Tier Mapping

| Tier | Card / badge fill | Text |
|---|---|---|
| Common | `--color-canvas` + 1px `--color-hairline` | `--color-ink` |
| Epic | `--color-accent-purple` | `--color-on-primary` |
| Legendary | `--color-accent-orange` | `--color-on-primary` |
| Mythic | `--color-accent-pink` | `--color-on-primary` |

- No gradients in the UI. (The unicorn's rainbow effects belong to Part II.)
- Tier is never conveyed by color alone; always show the tier name.

---

## 3. Typography

### 3.1 Family
- **Inter** (self-hosted, `font-feature-settings: "ss01"`) for every role. Weights **400 / 500 / 550 / 600 only**.
- **Inconsolata** for rare technical/mono labels.
- Fallback: `Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`.
- Fonts are bundled locally; no runtime requests to font servers.

### 3.2 Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `timer` | `clamp(96px, 22vw, 240px)` | 500 | 1.0 | -1% | Focus timer (`tabular-nums` required) |
| `timer-sm` | `clamp(64px, 14vw, 120px)` | 500 | 1.0 | -1% | Break timer |
| `display-xl` | 56px | 600 | 58.24px | -0.56px | Reserved (onboarding) |
| `display-lg` | 44.8px | 600 | 46.6px | 0 | Reward animal name |
| `display-md` | 32px | 500 | 41.6px | 0 | Screen titles |
| `display-sm` | 24px | 500 | 31.2px | 0 | Sub-section titles |
| `display-xs` | 20px | 500 | 28px | 0 | Card titles |
| `eyebrow` | 15px | 500 | 19.5px | +1.5px, UPPERCASE | Section labels (`FOCUS`, `BREAK`, `TIMER`) |
| `eyebrow-sm` | 12px | 500 | 12px | +0.6px, UPPERCASE | Tier badges, metadata |
| `body-md` | 16px | 400 | 25.6px | -0.16px | Default body |
| `body-md-strong` | 16px | 500 | 25.6px | -0.16px | Emphasized body, wordmark |
| `body-sm` | 14px | 400 | 22.4px | 0 | Secondary text |
| `body-sm-strong` | 14px | 500 | 22.4px | 0 | Labels |
| `caption` | 12.8px | 550 | 15.36px | 0 | Badges, counters |
| `caption-mono` | 12px | 400 | 18px | 0 | Technical labels (Inconsolata) |
| `button` | 16px | 500 | 25.6px | -0.16px | Button labels |

### 3.3 Rules
- Never 700+; never below 400.
- Negative tracking at large sizes only.
- Uppercase only for eyebrows and badges; everything else in sentence case.
- Timer digits always use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` so the layout never shifts.

---

## 7. Screens

### 7.1 Home
- Background: Part II scene (sky + island), full-bleed.
- Top bar.
- Bottom-center `panel`: `eyebrow` `25 MIN FOCUS · 5 MIN BREAK`, `button-primary` `Start focus`.
- The panel is the only interactive DOM area over the scene; everywhere else pointer drags rotate the island (see 13).

### 7.2 Focus
- Background `--color-primary`; island visible under `--color-overlay-focus`.
- Center: `timer` in white. Above it: `eyebrow` `FOCUS` in `--color-mute-soft`.
- Overtime: `badge-overtime` replaces the eyebrow; timer shows `+05:23`; `button-primary-inverse` `End focus` appears below.
- Hidden control: `button-hold` `Hold to stop`, shown at 50% opacity on pointer move / tap, fades after 3s.
- **Nothing else**: no top bar, shadows, toasts, or modals.

### 7.3 Break
- Background: Part II scene, bright.
- Reward: `card-tier` with `badge-tier`, name in `display-lg`, rotating voxel model inside. Level 2.
- No reward: `card-feature` with the neutral message.
- Below: `eyebrow` `BREAK`, `timer-sm`, `button-primary` `Start focus now`, `button-secondary` `Home`.
- **Layout.** Everything sits in one `panel` (max width 400px, so `timer-sm` fits on one line). Below 992px: bottom-center, full width minus gutters. From 992px: right-aligned (gutter `--space-3xl`) and vertically centered, so the island stays visible.
- **Reward card contents.** `badge-tier` (top), a 160px-tall transparent 3D preview with the model rotating slowly (one turn per 8s), the name in `display-lg`. The card fill follows the tier (2.4).
- **Reveal.** On entering Break the card fades in over `--motion-slow` (8px upward translate), the tier chime plays, and the model spins. After 3.5s, or when the card is tapped, the new animal appears on the island with a 300ms fade/scale-in from 0.6 to 1. The buttons are usable the whole time.
- **Break over.** The eyebrow `BREAK` is replaced by `Ready for the next one?` in `display-sm`, the timer is hidden, and `Start focus` becomes the primary button.
- **Reduced motion.** No spinning; the model is shown at a fixed 3/4 angle and the animal appears instantly.

### 7.4 Settings
- Canvas, `display-md` title, `settings-row`s grouped under `eyebrow` labels (`TIMER`, `SOUND`).
- `TIMER`: `Focus length` and `Break length` as `stepper`s in minutes (focus 5–60 step 5, break 1–30 step 1), with a `body-sm` `--color-body-mid` unit label `min`.
- `SOUND`: `Chimes` as a `toggle`.
- Content is a single column, max width 560px, centered; changes save immediately (no save button).

### 7.5 Collection
- Canvas, `display-md` title, card grid (1 / 3 / 4-up).
- Collected: `card-tier`. Not collected: `card-feature` with silhouette and `???`.
- **Card contents.** A 96px pixel-art sprite of the animal (front view, nearest-neighbor scaled), the name in `display-xs`, `badge-tier`, and a `caption` count `×3` when more than one is owned. Silhouettes are solid `--color-mute-soft` shapes.
- **Stats strip** above the grid: three `card-feature`s (`FOCUS TIME` as `12 h 40 min`, `SESSIONS`, `ANIMALS` as `7 / 20`), each with an `eyebrow` label and a `display-sm` value. Stacked 1-up on Mobile, 3-up from Tablet.

| End focus | `End focus` |
| No reward (< 25 min) | `Nice work. Focus for 25 minutes or more to meet a new friend.` |
| Abandon | `Hold to stop` |
| Break over | `Ready for the next one?` |

- All strings live in `src/ui/strings.ts`.

---

## 11. Accessibility

- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (check `--color-mute-soft` on `--color-primary` and white on every tier fill).
- Keyboard: `Space` = primary action, hold `Esc` = abandon.
- Focus ring: 2px `--color-primary` (light) or white (dark), 2px offset.
- Tier never conveyed by color alone.

---

## 12. UI Do's and Don'ts

**Do**
- Near-black primary buttons on light surfaces; white (polarity flip) on dark.
- Accents only for tier fills, badges, and the abandon ring.
- 4px buttons, 8px cards.
- Level 2 layered shadows for panels over the island.
- Uppercase eyebrows to mark sections.

**Don't**
- Weights above 600 or below 400.
- Accent-colored buttons, pill buttons, UI gradients, new accent colors.
- Shadows, toasts, or modals on Focus.

---

# Part II — Rendering

## 13. Scene and Camera

- One persistent `<Canvas>` shared by Home, Focus, and Break (never remounted between them).
- **Orthographic camera**, isometric angle: azimuth 45°, elevation ≈ 35.26°.
- Island centered; zoom fits the island's top surface (plus 35% of the underside, which may crop at the bottom edge) with a 5% margin, recalculated when the island grows. This shows blocks about 2x larger than fitting the whole floating island; larger islands make the camera pull back to keep the top surface in view.
- Home: limited rotation/zoom `[ASSUMPTION]`. Focus and Break: camera fixed.
- Renderer: antialias on, `outputColorSpace = SRGBColorSpace`, pixel ratio capped at 2.

## 14. World Palette

Defined in `src/world/palette.ts`. Not shared with UI tokens.

### 14.1 Sky

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `sky-top` | `#9FD8FF` |
| `sky-bottom` | `#EAF6FF` |
| `cloud` | `#FFFFFF` (opacity 0.9) |

### 14.2 Blocks

| Block | Top | Side |
|---|---|---|
| Grass | `#7BC950` | `#5FA83E` edge over dirt |
| Dirt | `#9B6B43` | `#86593A` |
| Stone | `#8A8F98` | `#747983` |

### 14.3 Water

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `water` | `#4FA8E8` (opaque) |
| `water-streak` | `#9AD4FF` (flow streaks) |
| `splash` | `#FFFFFF` |

## 15. Island

### 15.1 Structure
```
[ Top ]        Grass (animal tiles)
[ Layer 1 ]    Dirt
[ Layer 2..N ] Stone/dirt, narrowing downward with random gaps
```
- The underside is an inverted pyramid: the center column is about `coneSlope × half-width` layers deep (`config.island.coneSlope`), depth follows the smooth radius so the tip stays visible below the rim.
- 1 unit = 1 block.
- **Outline**: near-circular (Euclidean distance plus a small seeded jitter), 7×7 at the start.
- **Heights**: each surface tile is level 1–3 and one level is **0.5 block** tall (surface at 0.5 / 1.0 / 1.5 above the base plane). Level 1 is one full block; each extra level adds a half-height slab (grass on top, dirt below).
- **Terrain shape**: domain-warped fractal noise plus a weak tilt that raises the back (`-x`, `-z`) and lowers the front. Heights are terraced: a wide middle band is level 2 (plains), with level 3 hills and level 1 lowlands as smaller patches. Terrain is blended flat (level 2) around the camp, so hills never enclose the hut.
- One `InstancedMesh` per block type.
- Pixel-art textures (low resolution, `NearestFilter`) or flat colors.
- Shape rules (size, seed, growth) are defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### 15.2 Clouds
- 3–6 low-poly voxel clouds drifting slowly behind the island (Home and Break only). Unlit flat `cloud` color at 0.9 opacity, built from overlapping boxes at 55% scale.

### 15.3 Render Modes

| Screen | Mode |
|---|---|
| Home | Full: 60fps, all animations, clouds, interaction |
| Focus | Dimmed: fixed camera, animals slowed or paused `[ASSUMPTION]`, no clouds, frame rate capped (20–30fps) or on-demand |
| Break | Full, camera fixed, reward reveal plays |

- Home → Focus: camera pulls back slightly over `--motion-scene` (1000ms) while the UI overlay fades in and the sky gradient fades out, so the dimmed island sits on the near-black `--color-primary` background.
- The island keeps clear of floating panels: the camera fits it into the screen area not covered by the Home panel (bottom) or the Break panel (right from 992px, bottom below).
- New animals are added to the scene only when the Break reveal plays.

### 15.4 Night Mode and Camp

- Theme is `light` (default, unchanged look) or `dark` (night), stored in settings and toggled from the top bar. It affects the world and the Focus overlay; UI surfaces keep their tokens.
- **Night sky**: gradient `#070B24` to `#1F2C5C` with ~40 small white stars, cross-fading with the day sky over `--motion-scene`. Clouds turn dim blue-grey at 35% opacity. Ambient light becomes cool blue (`#7F8FD8`, 0.32) and the directional light a faint moonlight (`#93A8FF`, 0.28). Lighting blends over about 1s.
- **Camp**: the island always has a campfire on the center tile and a small hut (1 tile) two tiles from it along `-x` (one empty block between them), its door facing `+x`, toward the campfire. Both tiles are reserved: animals are never placed on them, and both sit at terrain level 2.
  - **Hut**: a forest log cabin about 1.5 blocks wide (1.3 × 1.0 body on a stone foundation, so it overhangs its tile slightly; the terrain around it is flat). Walls are stacked horizontal logs alternating two browns (`#B98552` / `#9A6A3E`) with dark corner posts (`#5E3B20`); the roof is a stepped wooden-plank gable (`#8A5A36` / `#6F4528`, ridge along x, overhanging eaves, ridge cap); a stone chimney (`#9A9DA3`, dark cap) rises above the roof on the back side. The gable end faces +x with a framed door and a stone step; a framed window on the +z wall.
  - Day: the fire is a cold pit (three logs), the door and window are dark.
  - Night: flames (three stacked flickering boxes in orange/yellow/pale yellow), a warm point light (`#FF9A3C`) with gentle flicker, an additive radial glow on the ground (about 4 blocks wide), a warm glowing door and window, and three soft grey smoke cubes rising from the chimney in a loop.
- **Focus routines** (animals are 0.25x, see 16.2), triggered when the phase becomes `focus`, each animal starting after a random 0-0.8s delay, walking in a straight line and turning to face its direction with a small hop stride:
  - Day: every animal runs to the hut door, shrinks over 0.25s and disappears inside.
  - Night: animals walk to spots on the blocks nearest the hut (up to 3 per block), then lie on their side and breathe slowly (about 3.5% body scale, ~3s period).
  - Leaving Focus (Break or reload into Break): animals reappear at the door (day) or stand up (night) and walk back to their tiles. Reloading while in Focus shows the end state immediately. With reduced motion all of this snaps with no walking.

### 15.5 Stream

- One winding stream per island (deterministic from the seed). It starts about 2.3 tiles from the center on the back side of a chord, crosses the front half of the island (downhill on average) and leaves through the rim. It never touches the campfire or hut (at least 1.5 tiles away).
- **Path**: the best of many wobbling chords (angle, lateral offset, meander phase): no tile is cut below its natural level, it stays clear of the camp, is at least 5 tiles long on the smallest island, and prefers bends and one or two level steps. The tile path is corner-cut twice so bends are rounded, not right-angled.
- **Terrain is replaced, not reshaped**: a stream tile keeps the natural level of that tile (water never flows uphill, so a tile is only lowered to the level upstream when the terrain rises). Neighbor tiles are untouched: no raised banks, no clamping.
- **Bed and banks**: the tile's top block is cut down 0.25 block (dirt bed); the water surface sits 0.12 block above the bed. The water is an opaque ribbon 0.7 block wide, narrowing slightly where a bend is too tight for its width so it never folds over itself. Everything in the tile that is not water is filled with grass at the surrounding tile height by a smooth bank mesh: the channel is cut out along the curved ribbon edge (no voxel steps, no square notch), with a wall down to the bed that has a thin grassy lip on top and dirt below. The stream ends at the first rim tile it reaches (at least 4 tiles in): it falls straight ahead if that side is open, otherwise it turns once, like any other bend, toward the most outward open side. The bank reaches 0.03 block under the water edge so no bed shows between them. Where a bed tile's side is exposed (island rim or a lower neighbor), the bank continues down that side to the bed block (grassy lip over dirt), so it never reads as a thin floating sheet.
- **Spring**: the ribbon starts with a round head at the first tile, and water bursts up from it: about 22 white cubes (0.06–0.10 block) shoot up in all directions (2–3.4 blocks/s, up to ~1 block high), fall back into the pool and shrink (~1.1s life, repeating).
- **Falls**: at every level step the water leaves the lip on a horizontal tangent and curves down in a parabola (steepening to ~75°), then rounds out onto the lower bed. Where the stream reaches the island rim it falls outward, over the missing neighbor that points away from the center (never along the boundary), 2.5 blocks, and dissolves into mist.
- **Splash**: white voxel cubes (`splash`, 0.05–0.09 block) burst up and outward from every landing point, fall back and shrink, repeating (~0.8s life, 12 per fall).
- **Flow**: the water carries lighter streaks (`water-streak`) that scroll downstream (about 0.6 block/s). Focus slows this by `focusAnimalTimeScale`.
- **Reduced motion**: streaks and splash are static.
- Animals are never placed on water tiles (they are excluded from placement and from night sleeping spots).

## 16. Voxel Models

### 16.1 Format
```ts
// src/assets/voxels/<animalId>.ts
export const chick: VoxelModel = {
  size: [4, 5, 4],
  palette: { 1: '#FFD93D', 2: '#FF8C42', 3: '#1E1E1E' },
  voxels: [ /* [x, y, z, paletteIndex] */ ],
};
```
- Converted at runtime into one merged `BufferGeometry` per model with hidden faces culled and vertex colors.
- Geometry is built once per species and cached; each placed animal reuses it.

### 16.2 Scale
- Animal model voxel = **1/6 block** in model space. On the island, animals are drawn at **0.25x** (world voxel = 1/24 block), so a 6-voxel-wide animal is about 1/4 of a block wide; smaller and larger species keep their relative sizes. The Break reward card shows the model at full size.
- Height by tier: Common 3–5 voxels, Epic 5–7, Legendary 7–10, Mythic 10–12.

### 16.3 Style
- Max 6 palette colors per animal (Mythic up to 8).
- Flat colors, no textures on animals.
- Eyes: 1 voxel `#1E1E1E`, optional 1-voxel highlight.
- Rounded silhouettes from stepped voxels; avoid thin 1-voxel limbs.
- Models face `+Z`, origin at bottom center.

## 17. Lighting and Materials

- One directional light from top-left, one soft ambient light.
- `MeshLambertMaterial` with vertex colors, flat shading.
- Face brightness: top lightest, left medium, right darkest.
- No real-time shadows `[ASSUMPTION]`; soft blob shadow (transparent circle) under each animal.

## 18. World Motion

- Island bobbing: 4–6s cycle, amplitude ≤ 0.15 block.
- Animal idle: turn in place, short hop, move one tile; randomized intervals 3–8s.
- **Poke:** clicking an animal (Home and Break only, never Focus) cancels its current idle action, shows a white voxel speech bubble with a dark `!` (`#1E1E1E`) above its head for 1.2s, and immediately plays exactly one idle action (turn, hop, shuffle, or flop for the fish). The bubble faces the camera and follows hops. Reduced motion: bubble only, no action.
- **Fish:** flops in place (squash-and-stretch hop, side tilt every 2–4s).
- **Unicorn:** sparkle particles (max 8), rainbow mane. Gradients allowed here only.
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: disable bobbing, idle hops, and camera moves.

## 19. Performance

- Home: 60fps with 100 animals on a mid-range laptop.
- Focus: minimal GPU usage (see 15.3).
- Dispose geometries/materials on unmount; no per-frame allocations in render loops.
